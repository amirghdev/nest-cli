## About This Project
I already created a private basic NestJS application with some functions for myself, but I need a cli to import specific modules or functions from this project.Â 
With this basic cli, you can import all the modules you need from any of your GitHub repositories.Â 

## Install
Clone the project.Â 

- 1. clone the project

- 2. npm install

- 3. in package.json, edit the bin property to what name you want for your cli.Â 

- 4. chmod +x index.js Use this command to make your application executable. (linux only)

- 5. npm link for using this cli localy

- enjoy using it ðŸ˜„

I'm going to update this cli every day.Â Â 

CLI has some problems at the moment, and I will try my best to fix them. ðŸ‘‹
