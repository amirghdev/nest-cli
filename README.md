## About This Project
I already created a private basic NestJS application with some functions for myself, but I need a cli to import specific modules or functions from this project. 
With this basic cli, you can import all the modules you need from any of your GitHub repositories. 

## Install
Clone the project. 
- in package.json, edit the bin property to what name you want for your cli. 
chmod +x index.js Use this command to make your application executable.
npm link for using this cli localy
enjoy using it. 

I'm going to update this cli every day. 
At the moment, I only tested this cli on Linux and not on Windows. 
CLI has some problems at the moment, and I will try my best to fix them.
